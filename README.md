# Financial-Inclusion-in-Africa
This is my solution to a machine learning competition hosted by (zindi)[https://zindi.africa]

## Description
The objective of this competition is to create a machine learning model to predict which individuals are most likely to have or use a bank account. The models and solutions developed can provide an indication of the state of financial inclusion in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, while providing insights into some of the key factors driving individualsâ€™ financial security.
